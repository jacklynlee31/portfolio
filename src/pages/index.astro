<Layout title="Jacklyn - Technical Writer">
  <h1>Hi, I'm Jacklyn!</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a technical writer with a passion for transforming complex ideas into clear, engaging content. I also have experience in creative writing (both fiction and nonfiction), and front-end development.<br><br>
    Visit <a href="/projects">projects</a> for more info on my latest work.
    <!--
    When I'm not writing, you can find me:
    <ul>
        <li>🐈‍⬛ Discussing the meaning of life with my cat, Dolly.</li>
        <li>🎧 Sending carefully curated K-Pop playlists to my friends.</li>
        <li>👻 Watching horror movies (or any kind of movie, really).</li>
    </ul>
