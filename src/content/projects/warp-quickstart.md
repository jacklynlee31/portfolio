## Warp - Migrate to Warp & Quickstart guide

When I was working at Warp.dev, I helped improve their Migrate to Warp page and their Quickstart guide. Both were created to help new users get up and running with Warp. They wanted to provide a fast and easy way to show users how to install Warp and get it up and running right away.

### Testing

To start, I tested Warp myself. I also sat on a call with a few friends that had never used Warp before and asked them to walk through the process using the current docs. This gave me an idea of how accurate the existing docs were, and if there were any stumbling blocks. This research helped me build out the new Migrate to Warp page.

I also asked the Warp team about their audience. Their main audience was people who were familiar with other terminals and who wanted to easily take their setup and apply it to Warp.

### Identifying Pain Points

The old Quickstart guide had the installation instructions, but it didnâ€™t have a lot of the extra information that I felt was needed when someone first downloaded it. I checked with the team, looked through some GitHub issues, and even looked into some feedback on sites like Reddit. I saw that the big pain points for users were being able to set up Warp so that it runs and works exactly like their old terminal (wanted to do this without searching into the docs). So I felt it was important to have these sections like importing your settings and setting up Warp as the default shell.

### Surfacing important information

To finish building out the Quickstart guide, I created a kind of hierarchy of what I thought were the top of mind things for users based on my research. This included changing the terminal appearance, setting up keyboard shortcuts, etc. I then took that list to the Education team at Warp and asked them if there were things that they think should be added to the list based on what was top of mind for the company. Thatâ€™s how we filled out the end of the Quickstart where we have the list of links that point users to different parts of the docs where they can learn more about things like keybindings, setting up an appearance theme, and more. This also helped inform the 'Import additional settings` section in Migrate to Warp.
