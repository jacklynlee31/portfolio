## SPP - The Circuit

This project was completed during my time as a backend developer, where I took on the responsibility of creating a detailed timeline, project overview, and planning document for a client. The goal was to clearly communicate the development phases and key features of an internal social media platform, helping align stakeholders and development teams around realistic expectations and priorities.

### Project plan & timeline

Developed a comprehensive project plan and timeline for *The Circuit*, a social media-style internal application designed to connect employees at Southwest Power Pool (SPP). The platform enables employee profile management, group participation, and company news updates, with robust admin controls for managers.

### Key highlights

- Outlined a flexible nine-week development schedule prioritizing core functionality followed by testing and usability fixes
- Emphasized security features like two-factor authentication and VPN integration to protect sensitive employee data
- Balanced technical details with user experience considerations to ensure a practical and user-friendly product rollout

This project demonstrates my ability to translate complex technical requirements into clear, actionable plans that support collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and end users.
