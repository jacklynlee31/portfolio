## Netlify - Docs Homepage Redesign & Sanity Process Doc

In the summer of 2022, I started the Docs homepage redesign project at Netlify. The homepage at the time was functional, but I wanted to improve both the aesthetics and the content of the page. I also put together a quick internal guide on using Sanity with the new homepage, so the docs team could easily update and add content.

### Goals for the new homepage

Before the redesign, the homepage was overloaded with content:

The goals were to:
- Improve overall quality and end-to-end experience for our users.
- Highlight important features to help drive adoption.
- Decrease the average time spent on the homepage; users should be able to quickly find what they need and move forward.
- Align with current Netlify branding across the Docs and marketing sites.
- Set a good foundation for future Docs site improvements.

### First steps

I brought the docs team together to talk about what we envisioned for our new Docs homepage. As a team we created a basic wireframe to figure out what types of content we wanted to prioritize, and how we wanted to organize the new information.

An example of one of the team's earliest wireframes:

Some of our main priorities included:
- A way to highlight pages that drive growth and adoption.
- A space for a YouTube feature in collaboration with Netlify's Developer Experience team.
- Highlighting 'getting started' content and a space for Support/Help information.

We asked ourselves a variety of questions, like "What story do we want the homepage to tell?" and "How can we guide our users in an organic way, keeping their use cases in mind?"

I then took the wireframe to one of Netlify's designers for their expertise.

### Exploring and Iterating

For the next stage, I worked with our designer to explore different options and iterate on some mockups. In between each round, I took the design back to the Docs team so we could talk about what we wanted to see not only for the design, but also for the copy and content. We discussed the layout, how we would be embedding the video, which pieces of content would be automated, and more.

After iterating on the different designs, the Docs team and Design came together to choose a path forward. We were now ready to start implementing.

### Content & Sanity CMS

For the homepage content, it was important that I created content that would be easy to update for future Docs team members. The Netlify Marketing team leveraged Sanity as their CMS for updating the main Netlify blog and website. I decided it would be good for us to align with the rest of the Netlify sites, and saw this as an opportunity to surface relevant materials like Blog Posts or Case Studies in the Docs.

I used Sanity CMS to create sections of information that aligned with our goals for the homepage, which gave us the flexibility to create custom solutions for a range of challenges.

### Results and Improvements

In early 2023, our new homepage went live.

The improvements included:
- No more text dump or long scrolling times. The content is organized into sections, so it's easy to know where you are and even easier to find what you're looking for.
- Section for a highlighted video that we can change based on what the DevEx team wanted to highlight during that quarter.
- A Platform section with badges that show if a page has been recently updated.
- Quick links at the bottom for people to easily connect to the Netlify community, visit Support Forums, and find resources.

## Sanity Internal Process Doc

As part of the homepage redesign, I wrote an internal guide for the documentation team on how to use Sanity to update the new homepage. The guide walks through where content lives in the CMS, how to make edits, and how to publish changes â€” all written with non-technical users in mind.

The goal was to help the team feel confident updating content without needing to loop in engineers every time.
