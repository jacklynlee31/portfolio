## Netlify - Directory Sync

ðŸ‘‰ <a target="new" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504120012/https://docs.netlify.com/security/secure-netlify-access/directory-sync/">Check out the Directory Sync documentation!</a>

### Project Summary

At Netlify, I was assigned to work on the end-to-end documentation for Directory Sync, a new feature that allowed Enterprise teams to sync their existing identity provider with Netlify for streamlined user provisioning and de-provisioning. Directory Sync was part of Netlify's Enterprise security features, and the documentation served our Enterprise-level customers.

### Challenges

- Directory Sync was a complex new feature targeting a range of users, from security leads and IT administrators to smaller Enterprise teams who might not have a dedicated IT person. The users would all need clear documentation to guide them through setup and management.

- The feature was still under development as I began writing. This led to numerous changes with the code and the UI flow during the writing process.

### Getting Started & Testing

First, I did an audit of the current Netlify docs to see where the new Directory Sync information would fit in. I also tracked what existing docs content needed to change. The audit was shared with stakeholders during the writing process to ensure the team was on the same page.

Next, I spoke to developers, project managers, and designers to deepen my understanding of how the feature worked and what the user flow would look like.

I set up my own users and teams in both Netlify and in Okta, an identity provider. I integrated Okta with my Netlify team and tested provisioning and de-provisioning users, mapping user groups to different roles, and more. I took comprehensive notes and validated the flows and syncing behaviors.

### Documentation

I wanted the docs to be intuitive and as clear as possible, so I:
- Started with a high-level overview of the feature.
- Wrote task-based sections for enabling, managing, and removing Directory Sync.
- Prioritized easy-to-scan headings and actionable steps.
- Followed Netlify's docs style guide closely to maintain tone and voice, ensuring our docs stayed consistent.

### Results & Feedback

Positive feedback from Beta testers and early Enterprise users. Users reported the docs were easy to follow and saved them time. This helped reduce questions and issues during feature rollout.
