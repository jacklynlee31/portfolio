## Netlify - Git Contributors

While at Netlify, I worked as the docs writer for the Accounts & Billing team. One of the larger projects I worked on was the launch of the new Git Contributors role. This was a new, paid seat designed to let users trigger builds, deploys, or Deploy Previews without being full team members.

This was a company-level initiative, and it touched nearly every part of the platform: the Netlify UI, the docs, marketing efforts, and the pricing page.

### Getting started

Since this was a brand new role, there wasnâ€™t a playbook. I spent a lot of time getting to know how the feature actually worked. I talked with product, checked in with engineers, and set up regular meetings with my PM to make sure I wasnâ€™t missing anything.

I also started sharing drafts early, not just with product but with engineering too. I wanted the docs to feel aligned with what the teams were building, and I wanted to spot any gaps before launch. While the bulk of my work focused on documentation, I also helped with:

- UI copy inside the Netlify App
- Marketing emails and announcements for customers

A lot of the language work centered around clarity, especially around what the new Git Contributor role could do, who it was for, and what it cost.

### Pricing challenges

One of the more interesting parts of this project was that not everyone agreed on how clearly we should talk about pricing. Some folks wanted to keep it mostly on the pricing page and not surface it in the product or docs.

But Iâ€™ve seen how confusing it can be when cost info is hidden or unclear, and I brought that up. I suggested that we be more upfront, like adding a note in the docs that this was a paid role, and working with design to create temporary UI flags in the app to notify users when they were adding a paid seat.

It felt like a good balance. Users got the heads-up they needed, but the flags werenâ€™t permanent. We ended up getting some good feedback on that approach from early beta users. And even though the role changed a bit after I left, the core Git Contributor docs I wrote stayed in place.
